##  Abstracts
>- Making use of Euler method this passage researches the shoot range of a baseball at different angular velocities and then display the trajectory of the baseball in Vpython environment.

##  Principles
>- Considering gravity,air resistance and the effect of backspin(Magnus force),we have following formulas:

  >- I use Euler method to describe formulas above iterating the process again and again,and initialize x,y,z,v_x,v_y,v_z as lists so that I can draw the y-x curve with matplotlib.
  >- As for its 3-D display,I draw a baseball,two vertical walls and a playground with Vpython.Besides,I add materials to walls and the playground,and draw the trail of the baseball.

## Analysis
>- We can find that with the increase of angular speed the shoot range increases correspondingly.This is because the backspin provides the baseball with upward force,so the baseball can travel for a longer period.
>- If the angular speed is upward,things are different.As is shown in the screenshots of the display,the baseball move in both  y and z directions,which are seperately because of the Magnus force and gravity.
